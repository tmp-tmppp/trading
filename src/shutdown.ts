 * sending requests (without it, the requests that arrive while the server closes fail with 502). Then the steps run
 * one after the other: stop accepting requests, finish the ones in flight, stop the consumers and the relay, close
 * the broker and the pool. The consumers and the relay stop before the broker and the pool close, because they use both. A timer started
 * with the drain ends the process with 1 when all that takes longer than `delayMs` plus `timeoutMs`; it does not keep
 * the process alive. A step that fails ends the process with 1 too, and the steps after it do not run. A second signal
 * changes nothing.
 *
 * It takes its dependencies instead of reaching for them, so that the order and the timing are tested with fake timers.
