 * consumer is created, or brought to the spec's configuration, on every connect, as the publisher does for its stream.
 *
 * The service starts and serves without it: a missing stream (the other service may start later), a refused connection
 * or a failed consumer is logged and tried again after `reconnectDelayMs`. Messages are handled one at a time, in
 * order; a message is acknowledged only after the handler returned "ack", which is after the commit. "nak" asks for a
 * new delivery after `nakDelayMs`; the delivery number `parkAfter` parks the message instead (settleMessage), so one
 * failing event never holds back the others. stop() finishes the message in hand.
